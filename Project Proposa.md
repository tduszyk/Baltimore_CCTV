Project 2 Parameters

Proposal

Do Baltimore Police prioritize the enforcement of certain types of crimes with the use of CCTV Cameras?

Hypothesis

Our Hypothesis is that Baltimore Police (BPD) use CCTV cameras to enforce certain types of property crimes, largely affecting businesses.  Our goal is to investigate whether cameras are also placed in areas of the city with high rates of victim-based crime (non-property crimes).
