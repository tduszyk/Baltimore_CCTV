## Project 2 Parameters

### Proposal

Increasingly, municipal police departments are relying on CCTV camera technology to deter crime and make arrests. Based on the reported success of such approaches, new contractors are now testing air-based surveillance systems originally designed by the Air Force for use in war zones.  

Among large US cities, Baltimore has the highest per-capita murder rate for a large city in the U.S.  For over a decade, the city has been using CCTV technology to fight crime.  The program, designed to save government resources, relies on a system of over 700 privately-owned cameras that have been registered with the city for public safety use.  

Given this volunteer approach, we are interested in the geographic distribution of these cameras and any correlation with crime prevention in those areas.  

## Hypothesis

Our Hypothesis is that Baltimore Police (BPD) use CCTV cameras to enforce certain types of property crimes, largely affecting businesses.  Our goal is to investigate whether cameras are also placed in areas of the city with high rates of victim-based crime (non-property crimes).

### Methods

1. Use leaflet to plot the point (lat/long) of each CCTV camera in the Baltimore Open Data set.

2. Create a heatmap layer with various types of crimes (violent/drug/property crimes) from BPD Open Data.

Determine which types of crimes are most highly correlated with camera placement.
